  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>250 grams cubed boneless chicken</li>
    <li>1 - 1.5 tsp fresh ginger garlic paste</li>
    <li>½ tsp red chilli powder</li>
    <li>½ tsp black pepper powder</li>
    <li>¼ tsp turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
    <li>1 - 2 tsp lime juice</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps to cook</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clean the chicken pieces and place in a bowl</li>
    <li>Add all the spices, ginger garlic paste, salt, and lime juice to this</li>
    <li>Mix well until the chicken pieces are well coated.
      You can also mix the marinade ingredients first in
      the bowl and then add the chicken pieces and mix together.</li>
    <li>Cover and refrigerate for a few hours. You can also fry
       immediately if short on time.</li>
    <li>Heat oil for deep frying and gently add the chicken pieces
       to it without overcrowding them.</li>
    <li>Fry on medium heat stirring occasionally until the
       chicken pieces are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Take out one piece and test to see if the pieces
       are fully cooked.</li>
    <li>When done, drain and place on kitchen towels for the 
      excess oil to get absorbed.</li>
    <li>Proceed with the remaining pieces until all done.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with rice, any curry, and a simple salad.
       It's best to consume chicken fry on the same day you 
       prepare them </li>
